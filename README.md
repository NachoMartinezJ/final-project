# Welcome to Final Project!

## Project Goals
* Do an e2e analysis by your own:
  * Give some insights about a topic of your choice giving some arguments by:
    * Being able to transmit the analysis in an ordered way.
    * Using the statistical/ML techniques learnt during the last weeks.
    * Plotting the graphs in a useful way for the reader / listener.
  * Present your analysis in two ways and for two different audiencies:
    * Technical audience: you will present a paper.
    * Jury: you will do a presentation.
    
    
## Considerations
* You can be in team (3 max) or on your own.
* You can include ML or statistics or not. But to do a proper analysis you will need something...
* You can use the data from your last project.
* You can focus on:
  * Learning more on something that you need to grow.
  * Learning more on something that is where you feel comfortable.

## Deliverables
* A notebook with your analysis in a paper way. Jupyter or Zeppelin are allowed.
* A 10' presentation in the auditorium.
* A 10' presentation for the jury.
* Repository with your workflow + documentation + code. Even if you are working alone, you need to keep good practices!
* Database.

## General schedule
*Wednesday*
* Which will be your team/individual.
* Your topic.


*Thursday*
* Repository link.
* README overview (you have a template)
* Dataset chosen
* Teachers validation --NO CODE UNTIL HERE--

*Monday morning*
* Database schema validation.

*Monday*
* Data in the database.

*Tuesday evening*
* Analysis validation.

*Wednesday*
* First rehearshall.

*Thursday morning*
* General rehearshall.

*Thursday evening*
* Presentation!

## General advices
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!). Respect the deadlines.
* Ask for help vs Google is your friend.
* Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you ;)
* Documentate yourself. Know about the problem. Look for some analysis that someone did before you.
* Before doing a graph, think what you want to represent.
* Don't force yourself to use tecniques if it's not useful for your objective.

### Overview
Include the following points in your overview:

* What data/business/research/personal question you would like to answer?
Make sure the question description is human-friendly because you will have non-tech audience to see your final project presentation.
* Did you understand the context for the question and the scientific or business application?
* What is the hypothesis you would like to test in order to answer your question?
Frame your hypothesis with statistical/data languages (i.e. define Null and Alternative Hypothesis). You can use formulas if you want but that is not required.
* Did you consider whether the question could be answered with the available data?
* How will you test your hypothesis?
* How will you test your success?




### Data Preparation
Overview:
* What is your dataset about?
* Where/how did you obtain your dataset?
It can be either a public dataset or collected with API/web scraping.
Provide a link if possible.
* General description of the dataset such as the size, complexity, data types, etc.

### Data Ingestion & Database
* If you downloaded a dataset (either public or private), describe where you downloaded it and include the command to load the dataset.
* If you obtain the data via API/web scraping, provide the scripts.
* Provide a schema of your tables.

### Data Wrangling and Cleaning
Your full process of data wrangling and cleaning.
* Document your workflow and thinking process.

### Data Analysis
* Overview the general steps you will go through to analyze your data in order to test your hypothesis.
* Document each step of your data exploration and analysis.
* Print charts to demonstrate the effect of your work. Charts make your presentation look good too.
* If you use ML in your final project, also describe your feature selection process.

### Model Training and Evaluation
* Train your ML model, produce results, and evaluate.
* This is an iterative process. Try your best to improve your model performance by:
  * Try different models and select one that is the simplest yet produce the best result.
  * Try advanced techniques and see if they improve the result.

### Conclusion
* Summarize your data analysis result.
* State your conclusion of your hypothesis testing.
* Interpret your findings in terms of the human-understandable question you try to answer.

### What are the next steps?
